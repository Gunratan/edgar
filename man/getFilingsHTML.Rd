\details{
getFilingsHTML function takes CIK(s), form type(s), filing year(s), and quarter of the 
filing as input. The function imports edgar filings downloaded 
via \link[edgar]{getFilings} function; otherwise, it downloads the filings which are 
not already been downloaded. It then reads the downloaded filings, scraps filing text
excluding exhibits, and saves the filing contents in 'Edgar filings_HTML view' 
directory in HTML format. The new directory 'Edgar filings_HTML view' will be 
automatically created by this function. According to SEC EDGAR's guidelines a 
user also needs to declare user agent.

CIK = 1000180 in quarters 1,2, and 3 of the year 2006. These filings
