\title{Provides sentiment measures of EDGAR filings}
\usage{
getSentiment(cik.no, form.type, filing.year, useragent)
}
\arguments{
\item{cik.no}{vector of CIK number of firms in integer format. Suppress leading 
zeroes from CIKs. Keep cik.no = 'ALL' if needs to download for all CIKs.}

\item{form.type}{character vector containing form type to be downloaded. 
form.type = 'ALL' if need to download all forms.}

\item{filing.year}{vector of four digit numeric year}

\item{useragent}{Should be in the form of "Your Name Contact@domain.com"}
}
\value{
Function returns dataframe containing CIK number, company name, 
date of filing, accession number, and various sentiment measures. 
This function takes the help of Loughran-McDonald (L&M) sentiment 
dictionaries (https://sraf.nd.edu/textual-analysis/resources/) to 
compute sentiment measures of a EDGAR filing. Following are the 
definitions of the text characteristics and the sentiment measures:

file.size = The filing size of a complete filing on the EDGAR server in 
kilobyte (KB).

word.count = The total number of words in a filing text, excluding HTML 
tags and exhibits text.

unique.word.count = The total number of unique words in a filing text, 
excluding HTML tags and exhibits text.

stopword.count = The total number of stop words in a filing text, 
excluding exhibits text.

char.count = The total number of characters in a filing text, excluding 
HTML tags and exhibits text.

complex.word.count = The total number of complex words in the filing text. 
When vowels (a, e, i, o, u) occur more than three times in a word, then 
that word is identified as a complex word.

lm.dictionary.count = The number of words in the filing text that occur 
in the Loughran-McDonald (LM) master dictionary.

lm.negative.count = The number of LM financial-negative words in the 
document.

lm.positive.count = The number of LM financial-positive words in the 
document.

lm.strong.modal.count = The number of LM financial-strong modal words 
in the document.

lm.moderate.modal.count = The number of LM financial-moderate Modal 
words in the document.

lm.weak.modal.count = The number of LM financial-weak modal words in 
the document.

lm.uncertainty.count = The number of LM financial-uncertainty words 
in the document.

lm.litigious.count = The number of LM financial-litigious words in 
the document.

hv.negative.count = The number of words in the document that occur in 
the 'Harvard General Inquirer' Negative word list, as defined by LM.

\code{getSentiment} computes sentiment measures of EDGAR filings
}
\details{
getSentiment function takes CIK(s), form type(s), and year(s) as input parameters.  
The function first imports available downloaded filings in the local working directory 
'Edgar filings_full text' created by \link[edgar]{getFilings} function; otherwise, 
it automatically downloads the filings which are not already been downloaded.
It then reads, cleans, and computes sentiment measures for these filings. 
The function returns a dataframe with filing information and sentiment measures.
According to SEC EDGAR's guidelines a user also needs to declare user agent.
